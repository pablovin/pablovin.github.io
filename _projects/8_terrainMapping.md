Project hold in partnership with the SPI Team. It has as the main goal to develop a mobile robot which was able to map terrain. The robot, named ARATU, was developed by the SPI Team and delivered at the University of Pernambuco, where a series of different software modules were implemented. The vision-team which I lead developed a computer vision module for SLAM, map stitching, and localization.
