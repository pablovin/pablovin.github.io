Chef's Hat is a four-players competitive card game designed to be played by humans and artificial players. Its rules were developed to allow a fast learning curve, but the game mechanics permit the emergence of fo rich strategies to beat your adversaries. The entire game was built with the interaction between humans and agents in mind, and all the game design elements are easily captured by humans and parsed by automatic perception systems. Interaction between the players is the main aspect of the game, and to develop harmonic gameplay scenarios between artificial players and humans is our main goal.

To achieve our goal, we study and propose the development of artificial players that learn how to play the game in a competitive manner against humans. Our end-term goal is to provide a holistic development cycle, introducing novel mechanisms for automatic perception, decision making, competitive strategy development, and an embodied response in terms of action generation. The entire project is focused on modeling, understanding, and modulating the decision making of an artificial agent based on the social interaction between the players and the game state.
