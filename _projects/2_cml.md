The goals of project A5 are (1) to develop novel neurocomputational techniques to improve our understanding of the superior colliculus (SC) and linked cortical areas; (2) to design and implement a self-organizing audiovisual model of these cortico-collicular networks in a physical robot; and (3) to compare both the model’s neural activity and the robot’s physical behaviour to the neural activity and physical behaviour of humans. The project will produce a novel computational architecture that can direct a robot’s gaze in a natural way to relevant stimuli.
