This project is a chatbot management system based on Streamlit and Llama-index that allows users to create chatbots, manage them and interact with them.
The chatbots use a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, powered by Llama-index, to gather knowledge from text files or a media wiki website.
It then uses OpenAI ChatGPT or Ollama to serve an LLM to consume this knoweldge, and interact with different users.
This project started as a system to help on organizing my role-playing gaming sessions, but was extended to support any generic scenario.
When combined with a MediaWiki access, it is an ideal solution for the consumption, interpretation and transformation of collaborative knowledge. PT or Ollama. The chatbot is capable of handling various queries and providing context-based responses.
