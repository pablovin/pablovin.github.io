Welcome to my personal website! Here, you can explore the fascinating intersections of **my career in artificial intelligence**, where the science of understanding meets the art of innovation.

Over the last decade, I've delved into the realms of artificial neural networks, focusing on enriching human experiences through advancements in **affective computing, social signal processing, and human-robot interaction**. I have worked with affective and social robots, as well as crafting intelligent agents for games that push the boundaries of interaction and engagement. Most of my work is focused on **designing, training and evaluating different machine learning systems**, and providing solutions for better understanding and modeling humans in automated systems.

This site is a gateway to the projects that have defined my careerâ€”from my academic roots, where I completed my PhD and continued as a postdoctoral researcher at the **University of Hamburg**, to my time at the **Italian Institute of Technology**, where I further honed my expertise. Now, at **Sony**, working on the Digital Profile team, I apply this wealth of knowledge to drive innovation and create substantial business value, blending scientific rigor with strategic application.
