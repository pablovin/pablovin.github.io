We are incredibly proud to announce that 10 of our brilliant students from Team Visão, at the University of Pernambuco, had the amazing opportunity to present their research work at the prestigious Latin American Summer School in Robotics (LACORO 2024), held in Rancagua, Chile. During the event, they participated in intensive workshops and tutorials, in addition to attending lectures given by some of the most renowned researchers in the fields of robotics, computational cognition, and machine learning.

And we have even more exciting news to share: Team Visão was a standout at the event, competing in all award categories – best undergraduate, master's, and doctoral poster. We returned home with the trophy for Best Undergraduate Presentation, an incredible achievement by our student Alexandre R M Pereira!

We celebrate the effort and dedication of everyone involved and will continue to promote excellence in research and innovation. Congratulations to all the participants and winners!
