    - title: <a href="https://github.com/pablovin/ChefsHatGYM">Chef`s Hat - A Game Platform for Social Interaction Studies</a>
      year: 2019-now
      description: Bulding a platform for social interaction and artificial intelligence studies based on a multiplayer card game.

    - title: <a href="https://www.crossmodal-learning.org/projects-phase1/area-a/a5-neurobotic-brain.html">Crossmodal learning in a neurobotic cortical and midbrain model</a>
      year: 2016-2019
      description: The goals of project A5 are (1) to develop novel neurocomputational techniques to improve our understanding of the superior colliculus (SC) and linked cortical areas; (2) to design and implement a self-organizing audiovisual model of these cortico-collicular networks in a physical robot; and (3) to compare both the model’s neural activity and the robot’s physical behaviour to the neural activity and physical behaviour of humans. The project will produce a novel computational architecture that can direct a robot’s gaze in a natural way to relevant stimuli.
